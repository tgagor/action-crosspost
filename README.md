**Crosspost your latest content to social media directly from GitHub Actions.**
This action fetches URLs from a `sitemap.xml` or RSS/Atom feed, filters them by age, and posts them to your configured social networks using [humanwhocodes/crosspost](https://github.com/humanwhocodes/crosspost).

---

## ‚ú® Features

* Supports both **sitemaps** and **RSS/Atom feeds**.
* Crosspost to **multiple networks in one go** (Twitter/X, Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn, etc.).
* Filter by **age** (`since` + `since-unit`) and by **URL include/exclude patterns**.
* Run in **dry-run mode** to safely preview what would be posted.
* Flexible failure strategies: stop on error or continue with other posts.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important First Step

Start with `dry-run: true` to ensure you don‚Äôt flood your social networks with hundreds of posts on the first run.
Once you confirm the filtering works as expected, remove `dry-run` or set it to `false`.

---

## üìÜ Recommended Scheduling

Run this action **once a day** at a time when your audience is most likely online ‚Äî for example:

* **09:00** (morning commute)
* **17:00** (after work)

Example scheduler trigger:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'   # every day at 09:00 UTC
```

## üí° Notes & Best Practices

* **Sitemaps** may mark pages as updated, so posts could appear again even if they were published earlier.

  * If you want to avoid reposting updated content, prefer using **RSS/Atom feeds**, which rely on the original publication date.
* Always begin with `dry-run: true` to validate your filtering before posting.
* Use `exclude-urls` and `filter-urls` to fine-tune which links should actually be posted.
